# AI Valley Logo Placeholder

## ⚠️ Important: Add Your Logo Here

This directory should contain the AI Valley logo file:
- **File name**: `ai-valley.png`
- **Location**: `/public/ai-valley.png`

## Quick Setup

1. Get the AI Valley logo file
2. Name it `ai-valley.png`
3. Place it in this `/public` directory
4. Delete this README file

## Logo is Used In:
- Navigation bar (top of every page)
- Hero section (main banner)
- Sponsors section (featured placement)
- Footer (bottom of every page)

The website will work without the logo (shows text fallback), but it looks much better with it!
