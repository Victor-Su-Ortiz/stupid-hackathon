# âœ… Vercel 404 Error - FIXED

## What Was Causing the 404 Errors

The 404 errors you were seeing in the browser console were due to missing resources that the browser was trying to fetch:

1. **Missing Open Graph Image** - The metadata referenced `/og-image.png` which didn't exist
2. **Missing metadata configuration** - No `metadataBase` was set
3. **Missing web manifest** - Browsers look for this by default
4. **Missing sitemap** - Search engines look for this

## What I Fixed

### 1. âœ… **Dynamic Open Graph Image Generation**
- Created `app/opengraph-image.tsx` that generates OG images dynamically
- No need for static image files
- Beautiful gradient design matching your theme

### 2. âœ… **Updated Metadata Configuration**
- Added `metadataBase` to `app/layout.tsx`
- Removed hardcoded image references
- Added proper favicon configuration

### 3. âœ… **Added Web Manifest**
- Created `app/manifest.ts` for PWA support
- Defines app name, colors, and icons

### 4. âœ… **Added Sitemap**
- Created `app/sitemap.ts` for better SEO
- Lists all main sections of the site

### 5. âœ… **Added robots.txt**
- Created `public/robots.txt` to prevent crawler 404s

## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Push the Latest Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix 404 errors - add OG image, manifest, sitemap"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **On Vercel Dashboard**

#### Environment Variables (REQUIRED!)
Add these in Settings â†’ Environment Variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL=community@aivalley.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_AIVALLEY_URL=https://aivalley.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_EVENT_DATE=2025-09-20
```

Optional (if you have a custom domain):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

#### Clear Cache
1. Go to Settings â†’ Functions
2. Click "Purge Cache"
3. Trigger a redeploy

### 3. **Verify Deployment**
After deployment, check:
- Main page loads: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
- OG image works: `https://your-app.vercel.app/opengraph-image`
- Manifest loads: `https://your-app.vercel.app/manifest.webmanifest`
- Sitemap loads: `https://your-app.vercel.app/sitemap.xml`

## Testing Locally

```bash
# Build and run production locally
npm run build
npm start

# Open http://localhost:3000
# Check browser console - should have NO 404 errors
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Still Getting 404?
1. **Check Build Output** - Look for any errors in Vercel's build logs
2. **Verify File Structure** - Ensure all files are in correct directories
3. **Check Environment Variables** - Missing env vars won't cause 404, but will break functionality

### If Main Page Shows 404:
1. Ensure Vercel is building from repository root
2. Check "Root Directory" setting in Vercel (should be empty or `.`)
3. Verify Framework Preset is "Next.js"

## Resources Created
- `app/opengraph-image.tsx` - Dynamic OG image generation
- `app/manifest.ts` - Web app manifest
- `app/sitemap.ts` - SEO sitemap
- `public/robots.txt` - Crawler instructions

## Support
If issues persist after these fixes:
1. Check Vercel Function logs for errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
